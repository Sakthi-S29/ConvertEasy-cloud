# üå©Ô∏è ConvertEasy ‚Äì Cloud-Native File Conversion Platform

**ConvertEasy** is a cloud-native application that enables users to convert files (documents, images, audio, video) from one format to another via a user-friendly web interface. It is built on modern AWS cloud services using Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform), ensuring full automation, scalability, and security.

---

## üß≠ Workflow Overview

Here's how the **ConvertEasy** system works end-to-end:

### 1. **User Interaction**
- The user accesses the static frontend hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket.
- They select a file and desired output format, then click **Convert**.

### 2. **File Upload**
- The frontend JavaScript sends a `POST` request to the `/convert` endpoint of the backend service (exposed via ALB).

### 3. **Backend Processing**
- The backend (FastAPI running in Docker on EC2) receives the file and:
  - Validates MIME type
  - Stores the raw file in the "uploaded" S3 bucket
  - Converts it using format-specific logic (LibreOffice, FFMPEG, etc.)
  - Stores the converted output in the "converted" S3 bucket
  - Generates a pre-signed URL and returns it to the frontend

### 4. **User Download**
- The user clicks the generated download link to retrieve their converted file directly from S3.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- Each conversion is asynchronously logged to DynamoDB.
- EC2 CPU is monitored using CloudWatch alarms.
- Optional: Alerts sent to SNS/email if usage spikes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ConvertEasy.git
cd ConvertEasy
```

### Step 2: Ignore Sensitive Files

```bash
echo "infrastructure/converteasy-key.pem" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Provision Infrastructure (Terraform)

```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

> üõë **Ensure all AWS services are provisioned before pushing Docker image.**

### Step 4: Build & Push Docker Image

```bash
cd scripts
bash build_and_push_to_ecr.sh
```

> üì¶ This builds a `linux/amd64` image, pushes to ECR, and applies only the `aws_instance.backend` target once image is available.

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Checklist

- Wait for EC2 to be marked as **healthy** in the **Target Group**.
- Access the app via the **S3 static site URL** or via **ALB DNS**.
- Monitor logs via **CloudWatch Logs**.
- Verify conversion logs in **DynamoDB**.
- (Optional) Check if SNS email alerts are received when CPU threshold is breached.

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

| Feature          | Optimization |
|------------------|--------------|
| Database         | Replaced RDS with DynamoDB to reduce idle cost |
| Compute          | EC2 runs in private subnet to reduce attack surface |
| Storage          | S3 lifecycle rules (optional) for file expiry |
| Monitoring       | CloudWatch alarms used judiciously (free tier) |

---

## üîê Security Measures

- EC2 instances have no public IP.
- S3 buckets are private (only accessible by LabRole IAM).
- All credentials passed securely via `.env` injected at boot.
- NAT Gateway used for EC2 outbound access.

---

## üßπ Cleanup

### Destroy the stack

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** ECR deletion will fail if images are present. Manually delete them or enable:
```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "backend_repo" {
  force_delete = true
}
```

---

## üìå Future Enhancements

- Add authentication using Cognito
- Replace EC2 with Fargate/Lambda
- Support queue-based conversion using SQS
- Add user dashboard with history and email reports

---

## üèÅ Final Note

This project brings together a complete cloud-native architecture, showcasing how various AWS services such as EC2, ECR, S3, ALB, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch can be orchestrated using Terraform to create a secure, resilient, and automated file conversion platform. The setup ensures that infrastructure provisioning, container deployment, logging, and monitoring are seamlessly integrated into a production-grade pipeline.

From managing network isolation with private subnets and NAT gateways, to implementing pre-configured environment variables, automatic container pulls, and dynamic front-end integration, every component is aligned with real-world cloud deployment practices.
